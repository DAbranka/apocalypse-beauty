To do so, we need to create a website with a stream first. So a homepage static like and then incorporate Vue.Js to make it dynamic. For the backend, we need to create a login/register system.

23 January - 24 January (2 days) :
If the homepage is done,the front will do the "About" page.

25 January - 26 January (2 days) :
Streaming features on the home page go next.

30 January- 17 February (3 weeks) :
Once the streaming features, the homepage and the about are done entirely, we can start to work on the e-Shop.
